Greetings everyone,<br>

This repository stores in code and releases the actual libraries for the game Unturned and plugins for RocketMod.<br>

Using the library for plugins is very simple: transfer all the files from the folder Libraries in the server folder under the path `/Rocket/Libraries`.<br>

All the necessary files can be found in [Releases](https://github.com/d3adwolf/unturned-libraries/releases), if you have any questions please contact [issues](https://github.com/d3adwolf/unturned-libraries/issues).
